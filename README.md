# 2dgame
Small and simple 2D game that uses SDL2 for rendering. Mainly working on this for fun while I have plenty of spare time.
:)

oh if you want to build it (requires SDL2 and cmake): 

1. create a build directory `mkdir build`

2. create make files `cmake -S . -B build`

3. build `make -C build`

4. run `build/2dgame`
